# FIFA World Cup Goal Analysis: Men vs Women â€“ Python Statistical Analysis

**Case study realised using Python for statistical analysis to compare the number of goals scored in men's and women's FIFA World Cup matches since 2002. This analysis includes hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference between the two.**

## Description
This project demonstrates how to perform a statistical analysis on FIFA World Cup match data to compare the number of goals scored in men's and women's international soccer matches. The goal of the analysis is to test the hypothesis that the mean number of goals in women's matches is greater than in men's matches. The analysis uses official FIFA World Cup data from both men's and women's competitions.

**Note:** The dataset used for this analysis is not publicly shared due to confidentiality reasons.

- **python-fifa-world-cup-goal-analysis.md**: Detailed case study document (Markdown format).

## Key Insights & Results
- **P-Value Analysis**: The p-value was used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis that the mean number of goals in women's matches is the same as in men's.
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The mean number of goals scored in women's matches is the same as in men's.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)**: The mean number of goals scored in women's matches is greater than in men's.
- **Statistical Test**: A two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was performed, depending on the normality of the data.
- **Result**: Based on the p-value, the null hypothesis was either rejected or failed to be rejected, indicating whether there is a significant difference in the number of goals scored.

## Next Steps
- **Further Exploration**: Conduct more granular analyses on specific tournaments to investigate any performance shifts over time.
- **Expanded Data Collection**: Include qualifiers and other related competitions for a broader scope of comparison.
